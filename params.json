Please let us\r\nknow about any errors or omissions you find.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the library automatically detects and reads the following fomats:\r\n  * GNU tar format (including GNU long filenames, long link names, and sparse files)\r\n  * Solaris 9 extended tar format (including ACLs)\r\n  * Old V7 tar archives\r\n  * POSIX ustar\r\n  * POSIX pax interchange format\r\n  * POSIX octet-oriented cpio\r\n  * SVR4 ASCII cpio\r\n  * POSIX octet-oriented cpio\r\n  * Binary cpio (big-endian or little-endian)\r\n  * ISO9660 CD-ROM images (with optional Rockridge or Joliet extensions)\r\n  * ZIP archives (with uncompressed or \"deflate\" compressed entries)\r\n  * GNU and BSD 'ar' archives\r\n  * 'mtree' format\r\n  * 7-Zip archives\r\n  * Microsoft CAB format\r\n  * LHA and LZH archives\r\n  * RAR archives\r\n  * XAR archives\r\n\r\nThe library also detects and handles any of the following before evaluating the archive:\r\n  * uuencoded files\r\n  * files with RPM wrapper\r\n  * gzip compression\r\n  * bzip2 compression\r\n  * compress/LZW compression\r\n  * lzma, lzip, and xz compression\r\n\r\nThe library can create archives in any of the following formats:\r\n  * POSIX ustar\r\n  * POSIX pax interchange format\r\n  * \"restricted\" pax format, which will create ustar archives except for\r\n    entries that require pax extensions (for long filenames, ACLs, etc).\r\n  * Old GNU tar format\r\n  * POSIX octet-oriented cpio\r\n  * SVR4 \"newc\" cpio\r\n  * shar archives\r\n  * ZIP archives (with uncompressed or \"deflate\" compressed entries)\r\n  * GNU and BSD 'ar' archives\r\n  * 'mtree' format\r\n  * ISO9660 format\r\n  * 7-Zip archives\r\n  * XAR archives\r\n\r\nWhen creating archives, the result can be filtered with any of the following:\r\n  * uuencode\r\n  * gzip compression\r\n  * bzip2 compression\r\n  * compress/LZW compression\r\n  * lzma, lzip, and xz compression\r\n\r\nNotes about the library architecture:\r\n\r\n * This is a heavily stream-oriented system.  There is no direct\r\n   support for in-place modification or random access.\r\n\r\n * The library is designed to be extended with new compression and\r\n   archive formats.  The only requirement is that the format be\r\n   readable or writable as a stream and that each archive entry be\r\n   independent.  There are articles on the libarchive Wiki explaining\r\n   how to extend libarchive.\r\n\r\n * On read, compression and format are always detected automatically.\r\n\r\n * I've attempted to minimize static link pollution.  If you don't\r\n   explicitly invoke a particular feature (such as support for a\r\n   particular compression or format), it won't get pulled in.\r\n   In particular, if you don't explicitly enable a particular\r\n   compression or decompression support, you won't need to link\r\n   against the corresponding compression or decompression libraries.\r\n   This also reduces the size of statically-linked binaries in\r\n   environments where that matters.\r\n\r\n * On read, the library accepts whatever blocks you hand it.\r\n   Your read callback is free to pass the library a byte at a time\r\n   or mmap the entire archive and give it to the library at once.\r\n   On write, the library always produces correctly-blocked output.\r\n\r\n * The object-style approach allows you to have multiple archive streams\r\n   open at once.  bsdtar uses this in its \"@archive\" extension.\r\n\r\n * The archive itself is read/written using callback functions.\r\n   You can read an archive directly from an in-memory buffer or\r\n   write it to a socket, if you wish.  There are some utility\r\n   functions to provide easy-to-use \"open file,\" etc, capabilities.\r\n\r\n * The read/write APIs are designed to allow individual entries\r\n   to be read or written to any data source:  You can create\r\n   a block of data in memory and add it to a tar archive without\r\n   first writing a temporary file.  You can also read an entry from\r\n   an archive and write the data directly to a socket.  If you want\r\n   to read/write entries to disk, there are convenience functions to\r\n   make this especially easy.\r\n\r\n * Note: \"pax interchange format\" is really an extended tar format,\r\n   despite what the name says.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
